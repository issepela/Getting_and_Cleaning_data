in the repo can be found:

- this read me file
- a codebook that explanins the variables
- a script that does the following:
  - 1.Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
  - 2.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
  - 3.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
  - 4.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
  - 5.From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
